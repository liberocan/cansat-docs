## What is a Cansat?
A CanSat is a powerful educational tool that simulates a satellite, cleverly designed to fit inside a soda can. It serves as an effective means to instruct students on the intricacies of satellite technology and operations. CanSats are equipped with cutting-edge sensors and advanced communication systems, enabling the collection and transmission of valuable data to a ground station. Through the challenging process of constructing and launching a CanSat, students gain profound insights into mission planning, payload integration, data analysis, and the significance of effective teamwork. This hands-on experience empowers students to apply their acquired knowledge in a practical and captivating manner.
